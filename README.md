If it comes to download manager for on click hoster, there are not many options
that are easy to install, convenient to use and fast at the same time. Most
used options are pyload that is in heavy refactoring at the moment and
JDownloader that is feature rich (maybe even bloated) and written in java. I am
using JDownloader till this application is in a usable state but
the startup times of JDownloader where the reason for this project.

I've decided to use rust as it is fast on the one hand and has great dependency
management on the other. Also this is a great oppertunity to learn rust in
a real project that I use in the future. Keep in mind that I consider myself
very new to rust and am constantly learning more about the language. Mistakes
will be made so be aware. Main focus is easy configuration of premium accounts
and support for the most common one click hoster, maybe a generic way to
support them can be realised. There will be no gui till the core functionality
is implemented. I haven't decided which framework to use for the gui yet but
main points should be cross plattform (as at least linux and windows should be
supported) and easy to use components with rust.
